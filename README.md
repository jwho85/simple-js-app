## The 5 Ws

1. Who—Your professional network, as well as potential employers. 
2. What—A JavaScript app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which uses an external API. 
3. When—Immediately! The code for the app can always be viewed in a repository like GitHub or GitLab. 
4. Where—Potential employers, clients, and collaborators might look at the code directly from your GitHub repository or be directed to your GitHub profile from your portfolio site (your project from Intro to Frontend Development). 
5. Why—For your potential employers, clients, and collaborators to see how you create the architecture of a JavaScript app, as well as how you test and debug your code.
